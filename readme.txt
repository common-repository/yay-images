Get free, professional images. Our plugin has million of images, a visual search and an editor.  Get the perfect image for your post within seconds.

== Description ==

You know that [images increase interaction and engagement](http://blog.bufferapp.com/?s=images) with your blog readers, right? And that [they lead to more sales conversions](http://socialtriggers.com/how-images-affect-conversions/), right? Of course you do!


But you’re also annoyed by using three different platforms to find, edit, and upload high-quality, legal images. (That’s valuable time you could spend watching cat videos.)


It might seem overly dramatic, but if you spend five minutes on each photo you source, modify, and upload you’re losing dozens of hours each year to fiddling and clicking - which is why we created this plugin.


**With our plugin, you can find the high-res, professional caliber images you want and customize +  optimize + upload them - all in one place.**

With our 5 million photos and illustrations you’ll always find the perfect something and you’ll find it in seconds with our visual search option. You’ll have more time to write blog posts, promote your work on social media, or even step away from the computer.


To make things as easy as possible, we’ve built an image editor into the plugin so you can crop, add filters and text within WordPress and our [images are SEO-friendly](http://yayimages.com/social-article/72-3-tricks-to-making-your-images-more-seo-friendly) as well, with relevant keywords placed in the link.


We know you’ll love our plugin, our images, and our editing tools which is why we’re giving you **five images of your choice - free**. All you have to do is install the plugin and register as a user from the plugin – no need for a credit card.


If you need more images, we have the world’s best offer (literally!) for legal, professional images. For just $9.90 a month, you get unlimited access to online images, our visual image search, and our editing tools. Add these images to your blog posts, social media, or other online design and marketing projects.
